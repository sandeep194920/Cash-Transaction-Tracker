###### NOTE:

For better comments in the code, I use `Better Comments` extension by `Aaron Bond`. This gives me colours in vscode so that I can do the below which provides code highlight

```js
// ** IMPORTANT COMMENT - Will be in green color
// *? INFO COMMENT - Will be in blue color
// *! DANGER COMMENT - Will be in red color
// TODO: - Will be in orange color 
```


```
